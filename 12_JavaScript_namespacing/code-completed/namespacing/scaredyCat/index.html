		<h1>Scaredy Cat</h1>
		<p>"The idea behind Scaredy Cat by Orchard Toys is simple. You take it in turns to collect bird cards. If you get a cat card you have to put all your cards back. As the game goes on you slowly build a Scarecrow. Whoever has the most birds when the scarecrow is complete wins. Simple." written by Orchard Toys</p>
